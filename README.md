# Unexpected token '}' in JSON at position 123 in Node.js

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Node.js where an 'Unexpected token }' error occurs during JSON parsing. The error message typically indicates an unexpected closing curly brace in the JSON response body at a specific position.

## Problem

The problem arises from improperly formatted JSON data in the response.  A mismatch of curly braces (missing or extra) can cause this parse error. The error message points to the position of the unexpected brace, but pinpointing the exact cause requires careful examination of the JSON response.

## Solution

The solution involves meticulously checking the JSON response for correct formatting.  Verify that all opening curly braces '{' have corresponding closing curly braces '}'.  Tools for JSON validation can assist in identifying issues.
